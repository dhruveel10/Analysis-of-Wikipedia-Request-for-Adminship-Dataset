#  Analysis of Wikipedia Request for Adminship Dataset

This was my Social Media Analytics course project.<br>
• Conducted an in-depth analysis of the voting process and selection of Wikipedia administrators.<br>
• Utilized networkx to analyze metrics such as Clustering coefficients, Link Prediction, Modularity analysis, and Small
World analysis and PageRank to gain insights into the voting patterns and dynamics.<br>
• Employed topic modeling techniques to extract meaningful themes from the comments accompanying the votes.<br>
• Performed sentiment analysis using NLTK's Vader to evaluate the sentiment expressed in the comments.<br>
• Implemented data preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, and punctuation removal to
enhance the accuracy of the sentiment analysis results.<br>
